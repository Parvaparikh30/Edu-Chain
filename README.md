# Edu-Chain

This is a blockchain dapp used for storing and viewing certificates of students which would be stored on ipfs. Solves the problem of fake certificates floating in market.Firstly to counter the problems of fake universities a mininstry is declared which only allows verified universities to join the network.Once in the network they will be given rights to upload as well as view the students certificates and degree,this eliminates the problem of fake certificates. Once these certificates are uploaded in IPFS network , the hash of certificate will be stored in the students address & students can easily view thier certificates using that hash.
Made this project using solidity , react , web3 , ipfs and a test blockchain of ganache.
